# Amazon Athena TPC-DS Connector

This connector enables Amazon Athena to communicate with a source of randomly generated TPC-DS data for use in benchmarking and functional testing of Athena Federation. We do _not_ recommend the use of this connector as an alternative to S3 based data lake performance tests.
