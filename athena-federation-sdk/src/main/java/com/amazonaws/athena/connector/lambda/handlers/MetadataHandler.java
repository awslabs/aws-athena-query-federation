/**
 * This class defines the functionality required by any valid source of federated metadata for Athena. It is recommended
 * that all connectors extend this class for Metadata operations though it is possible for you to write your own
 * from the ground up as long as you satisfy the wire protocol. For all cases we've encountered it has made more sense
 * to start with this base class and use it's implementation for most of the boilerplate related to Lambda and resource
 * lifecycle so we could focus on the task of integrating with the source we were interested in.
 *
 * @note All schema names, table names, and column names must be lower case at this time. Any entities that are uppercase or
 * mixed case will not be accessible in queries and will be lower cased by Athena's engine to ensure consistency across
 * sources. As such you may need to handle this when integrating with a source that supports mixed case. As an example,
 * you can look at the CloudwatchTableResolver in the athena-cloudwatch module for one potential approach to this challenge.
