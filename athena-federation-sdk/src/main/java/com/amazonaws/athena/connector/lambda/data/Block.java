/**
 * This class is used to provide a convenient interface for working (reading/writing) Apache Arrow Batches. As such
 * this class is mostly a holder for an Apache Arrow Schema and the associated VectorSchema (used for read/write).
 * The class also includes helper functions for easily loading/unloading data in the form of Arrow Batches.
 *
 * @note While using this class as a holder to encapsulate nuances of Apache Arrow can simplify your programming model
 * and make it easier to get started, using setValue(...), setComplexValue(...), and any of the related helpers to
 * write data to the Apache Arrow structures is less performant than using Apache Arrow's native interfaces. If your usecase
 * and source data can be read in a columnar fashion you can achieve significantly (50% - 200%) better performance by
 * avoiding setValue(...) and setComplexValue(...). In our testing conversion to Apache Arrow was not a significant
 * bottleneck and instead represented extra latency which could be hidden through parallelism and pipelining. This is why
 * we opted to offer these convenience methods.
 * <p>
 * Remember to always close your Block(s) when you are done with them. If you are using a BlockAllocator it is still
 * recommended that you close() Blocks explicitly wherever possible vs. depending on BlockAllocator.close() to free
 * resources. Closing Blocks earlier will reduce peak memory demands and reduce the chance that you exhaust your Apache
 * Arrow memory pool.
