/**
 * Used to apply predicates to values inside your connector. Ideally you would also be able to push
 * constraints into your source system (e.g. RDBMS via SQL). For each value you'd like to write for a given row,
 * you call the 'apply' function on this class and if the values for all columns in the row return 'true' that
 * indicates that the row passes the constraints.
 * <p>
 * After being used, ConstraintEvaluator instance must be closed to ensure no Apache Arrow resources used by
 * Markers that it creates as part of evaluation are leaked.
 *
 * @note This abstraction works well for the associative predicates that are made available to your connector
 * today but will likely require enhancement as we expose more sophisticated predicates (e.g. col1 + col2 < 100)
 * in the future. Additionally, we do not support constraints on complex types are this time.
 * <p>
 * For usage examples, please see the ExampleRecordHandler or connectors like athena-redis.
 * <p>
 * TODO: We can improve the filtering performance of ConstraintEvaluator by refactoring how ValueSets and Markers works.
 * @see ValueSet for details on how Constraints are represented and individually applied.
