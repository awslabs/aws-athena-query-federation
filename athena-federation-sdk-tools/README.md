of the tools that can be found in this module can be found below.

* **Connector Validator** - A runnable class which emulates the calls that Athena will make to your Lambda function as part of executing a
    select * from <database>.<table> where <optional constraint>. The goal of this tool is to help your troubleshoot connectors by giving you visibility of what 'Athena' would
    see. You can run this tool by using the helper script in the tools directory
    ../tools/validate_connector.sh --lambda-func lambda_func [--record-func record_func] [--catalog catalog] [--schema schema [--table table [--constraints constraints]]] [--planning-only] [--help]
