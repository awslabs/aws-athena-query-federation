## Example Athena Connector

This module is meant to serve as a guided example for writing and deploying a connector to enable Amazon Athena to query a custom data source. The goal is to help you understand the development process and point out capabilities. In some examples we use of hard coded schemas to separate learning how to write a connector from learning how to interface with the target systems you ultimately want to federate to. 

This tutorial also includes an an example of creating scalar User Defined Functions(UDFs) that you can use in your Athena queries. This tutorial creates several UDFs as part of a connector but you can deploy UDFs as standalone Lambda functions completely independent of a connector.

**Athena Federated Queries are now enabled as GA in US-East-1 (IAD), US-West-2 (PDX), and US-East-2 (CMH). To use this feature, upgrade your engine version to Athena V2 in your workgroup settings. Check documentation here for more details: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/engine-versions.html.  To enable this feature in other regions, you need to create an Athena workgroup named AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality and run any queries attempting to federate to this connector, use a UDF, or SageMaker inference from that workgroup.**

## What is a 'Connector'?

A 'connector' is a piece of code that can translate between your target data source and Athena. Today this code must run in an AWS Lambda function but in future releases we may offer additional options. You can think of a connector as an extension of Athena's query engine. Athena delegates portions of the federated query plan to your connector. You connector must provide the following:

1. A source of meta-data for Athena to get schema information about what databases, tables, and columns your connector has. This is done by building and deploying a lambda function that extends com.amazonaws.athena.connector.lambda.handlers.MetadataHandler in the athena-federation-sdk module. 
2. A way for Athena to read the data stored in your tables. This is done by building and deploying a lambda function that extends com.amazonaws.athena.connector.lambda.handlers.RecordHandler in the athena-federation-sdk module. 

Alternatively, you can deploy a single Lambda function which combines the two above requirements by using com.amazonaws.athena.connector.lambda.handlers.CompositeHandler or com.amazonaws.athena.connector.lambda.handlers.UnifiedHandler. While breaking this into two separate Lambda functions allows you to independently control the cost and timeout of your Lambda functions, using a single Lambda function can be simpler and higher performance due to less cold start.

In the next section we take a closer look at the methods we must implement on the MetadataHandler and RecordHandler.

### MetadataHandler Details

Lets take a closer look at MetadataHandler requirements. In the following example, we have the basic functions that you need to implement when using the Amazon Athena Query Federation SDK's MetadataHandler to satisfy the boiler plate work of serialization and initialization. The abstract class we are extending takes care of all the Lambda interface bits and delegates on the discrete operations that are relevant to the task at hand, querying our new federated data source.

```java
public class MyMetadataHandler extends MetadataHandler
{
    /**
     * Used to get the list of schemas (aka databases) that this source contains.
     *
     * @param allocator Tool for creating and managing Apache Arrow Blocks.
     * @param request Provides details on who made the request and which Athena catalog they are querying.
     * @return A ListSchemasResponse which primarily contains a Set<String> of schema names and a catalog name
     * corresponding the Athena catalog that was queried.
     */
    @Override
    protected ListSchemasResponse doListSchemaNames(BlockAllocator allocator, ListSchemasRequest request) {}

    /**
     * Used to get the list of tables that this source contains.
     *
     * @param allocator Tool for creating and managing Apache Arrow Blocks.
     * @param request Provides details on who made the request and which Athena catalog and database they are querying.
     * @return A ListTablesResponse which primarily contains a List<TableName> enumerating the tables in this
     * catalog, database tuple. It also contains the catalog name corresponding the Athena catalog that was queried.
     */
    @Override
    protected ListTablesResponse doListTables(BlockAllocator allocator, ListTablesRequest request) {}

    /**
     * Used to get definition (field names, types, descriptions, etc...) of a Table.
     *
     * @param allocator Tool for creating and managing Apache Arrow Blocks.
     * @param request Provides details on who made the request and which Athena catalog, database, and table they are querying.
     * @return A GetTableResponse which primarily contains:
     *             1. An Apache Arrow Schema object describing the table's columns, types, and descriptions.
     *             2. A Set<String> of partition column names (or empty if the table isn't partitioned).
     */
    @Override
    protected GetTableResponse doGetTable(BlockAllocator allocator, GetTableRequest request) {}

    /**
     * Used to get the partitions that must be read from the request table in order to satisfy the requested predicate.
     *
     * @param blockWriter Used to write rows (partitions) into the Apache Arrow response.
     * @param request Provides details of the catalog, database, and table being queried as well as any filter predicate.
     * @param queryStatusChecker A QueryStatusChecker that you can use to stop doing work for a query that has already terminated
     * @note Partitions are partially opaque to Amazon Athena in that it only understands your partition columns and
     * how to filter out partitions that do not meet the query's constraints. Any additional columns you add to the
     * partition data are ignored by Athena but passed on to calls on GetSplits. Also note tat the BlockWriter handlers 
     * automatically constraining and filtering out values that don't satisfy the query's predicate. This is how we
     * we accomplish partition pruning. You can optionally retreive a ConstraintEvaluator from BlockWriter if you have
     * your own need to apply filtering in Lambda. Otherwise you can get the actual preducate from the request object
     * for pushing down into the source you are querying.
     */
    @Override
    public void getPartitions(BlockWriter blockWriter, GetTableLayoutRequest request, QueryStatusChecker queryStatusChecker) {}

    /**
     * Used to split-up the reads required to scan the requested batch of partition(s).
     *
     * @param allocator Tool for creating and managing Apache Arrow Blocks.
     * @param request Provides details of the catalog, database, table, andpartition(s) being queried as well as
     * any filter predicate.
     * @return A GetSplitsResponse which primarily contains:
     *             1. A Set<Split> which represent read operations Amazon Athena must perform by calling your read function.
     *             2. (Optional) A continuation token which allows you to paginate the generation of splits for large queries.
     * @note A Split is a mostly opaque object to Amazon Athena. Amazon Athena will use the optional SpillLocation and
     * optional EncryptionKey for pipelined reads but all properties you set on the Split are passed to your read
     * function to help you perform the read.
     */
    @Override
    protected GetSplitsResponse doGetSplits(BlockAllocator allocator, GetSplitsRequest request) {}
}
```

You can find example MetadataHandlers by looking at some of the connectors in the repository. [athena-cloudwatch](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/tree/master/athena-cloudwatch) and [athena-tpcds](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/tree/master/athena-tpcds) are fairly easy to follow along with.

You can also, use the AWS Glue DataCatalog as the authoritative (or supplemental) source of meta-data for your connector. To do this, you can extend [com.amazonaws.athena.connector.lambda.handlers.GlueMetadataHandler](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/blob/master/athena-federation-sdk/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/athena/connector/lambda/handlers/GlueMetadataHandler.java) instead of [com.amazonaws.athena.connector.lambda.handlers.MetadataHandler](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/blob/master/athena-federation-sdk/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/athena/connector/lambda/handlers/MetadataHandler.java). GlueMetadataHandler comes with implementations for doListSchemas(...), doListTables(...), and doGetTable(...) leaving you to implemented only 2 methods. The Amazon Athena DocumentDB Connector in the [athena-docdb](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/tree/master/athena-docdb) module is an example of using GlueMetadataHandler.

### RecordHandler Details

Lets take a closer look at what is required for a RecordHandler requirements. In the following example, we have the basic functions we need to implement when using the Amazon Athena Query Federation SDK's [RecordHandler](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/blob/master/athena-federation-sdk/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/athena/connector/lambda/handlers/RecordHandler.java) to satisfy the boiler plate work of serialization and initialization. The abstract class we are extending takes care of all the Lambda interface bits and delegates on the discrete operations that are relevant to the task at hand, querying our new data source.

```java
public class MyRecordHandler
        extends RecordHandler
{
    /**
     * Used to read the row data associated with the provided Split.
     * @param constraints A ConstraintEvaluator capable of applying constraints form the query that request this read.
     * @param spiller A BlockSpiller that should be used to write the row data associated with this Split.
     *                The BlockSpiller automatically handles chunking the response, encrypting, and spilling to S3.
     * @param recordsRequest Details of the read request, including:
     *                           1. The Split
     *                           2. The Catalog, Database, and Table the read request is for.
     *                           3. The filtering predicate (if any)
     *                           4. The columns required for projection.
     * @param queryStatusChecker A QueryStatusChecker that you can use to stop doing work for a query that has already terminated
     * @note Avoid writing >10 rows per-call to BlockSpiller.writeRow(...) because this will limit the BlockSpiller's
     *       ability to control Block size. The resulting increase in Block size may cause failures and reduced performance.
     */
    @Override
    protected void readWithConstraint(ConstraintEvaluator constraints, BlockSpiller spiller, ReadRecordsRequest recordsRequest, QueryStatusChecker queryStatusChecker){}
}
```


## What is a scalar UDF?

A scalar UDF is a specific kind of UDF that is applied one row at a time and returns a single column value. Athena calls your scalar UDF with batches of rows (potentially in parallel) to limit the performance impact associated with making a remote call to the UDF itself.

For Athena to delegate UDF calls to your Lambda function, you need to implement a "UserDefinedFunctionHandler" in your Lambda function. The Athena Query Federation SDK offers an abstract [UserDefinedFunctionHandler](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/blob/master/athena-federation-sdk/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/athena/connector/lambda/handlers/UserDefinedFunctionHandler.java) that handles all the boilerplate-associated serialization and management of the UDF lifecycle. This allows you to simply implement the UDF methods themselves.

### UserDefinedFunctionHandler Details

UDF implementation is a bit different from implementing a connector. Let’s say you have the following query you want to run (we'll actually run this query for real later in the tutorial). The query defines two UDFs: "extract_tx_id" and "decrypt" which are hosted in a Lambda function specified as "my_lambda_function".

```sql
USING FUNCTION extract_tx_id(value ROW(id INT, completed boolean) ) 
    RETURNS INT TYPE LAMBDA_INVOKE
WITH (lambda_name = 'my_lambda_function'), FUNCTION decrypt(payload VARCHAR ) 
    RETURNS VARCHAR TYPE LAMBDA_INVOKE
WITH (lambda_name = 'my_lambda_function')
SELECT year,
         month,
         day,
         account_id,
         decrypt(encrypted_payload) AS decrypted_payload,
         extract_tx_id(transaction) AS tx_id
FROM schema1.table1
WHERE year=2017
        AND month=11
        AND day=1;
```

For this query, "UserDefinedFunctionHandler" would look like the one in the following example. Two methods in the example match the signatures of the UDFs I called in my query. For full data type and method signature information, see the [SDK documentation](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/blob/master/athena-federation-sdk/README.md).


```java
public class MyUDF extends UserDefinedFunctionHandler
{

    /**
     * This UDF extracts an 'Account' from the input STRUCT (provided as a Map). In this case 'Account' is
     * an application specific concept and very custom to our test dataset's schema.
     *
     * @param transaction The transaction from which to extract the id field.
     * @return An Integer containing the Transaction ID or -1 if the id couldn't be extracted.
     */
    public Integer extract_tx_id(Map<String, Object> transaction){}

    /**
     * Decrypts the provided value using our application's secret key and encryption Algo.
     *
     * @param payload The cipher text to decrypt.
     * @return ClearText version if the input payload, null if the decrypt failed.
     */
    public String decrypt(String payload)

}
```


## How To Build & Deploy

You can use any IDE or even just a command line editor to write your connector. The following steps show you how to use an AWS Cloud9 IDE running on EC2 to get started but most of the steps are applicable to any Linux based development machine.

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have the [proper permissions/policies to deploy/use Athena Federated Queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/federated-query-iam-access.html).

### Step 0: How to deploy a pre-built connector

If you have not previously used Athena Query Federation, we recommend you begin by deploying a pre-built connector to build an understanding of our basic building blocks (Lambda, Serverless Application Repository, and using Lambda in SQL). This deployment introduction takes just five minutes and can be found by [clicking here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/wiki/How-To-Deploy-A-Connector).

### Step 1: Create Your Cloud9 Instance

1. Open the AWS Console and navigate to the [Cloud9 Service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)
2. Click **Create Environment** and follow the steps to create a new instance using a new EC2 Instance (we recommend m4.large) running Amazon Linux.


### Step 2: Download The SDK + Connectors

1. At your Cloud9 terminal run `git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation.git` to get a copy of the Amazon Athena Query Federation SDK, Connector Suite, and Example Connector.

### Step 3: Install Prerequisites for Development

1. If you are working on a development machine that already has Apache Maven, the AWS CLI, and the AWS SAM build. If not, you can run  the `./tools/prepare_dev_env.sh` script in the root of the Github project you checked out.
2. To ensure your terminal can see the new tools that we installed run `source ~/.profile` or open a fresh terminal. If you skip this step you will get errors later about the AWS CLI or SAM build tool not being able to publish your connector.

Now run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=true > /tmp/log` from the athena-federation-sdk directory within the Github project you checked out earlier. We are skipping tests with the `-DskipTests=true` option to make the build faster. As a best practice, you should let the tests run. If you are building on Cloud9 we've found that redirecting stdout to a log with `> /tmp/log` speeds up the build by 4x due to the browser trying to keep up with all the output logging associated with maven downloading dependencies. 

### Step 4: Write The Code

1. Create an s3 bucket (in the same region you will be deploying the connector), that we can use for spill and to upload some sample data using the following command `aws s3 mb s3://BUCKET_NAME` but be sure to put your actual bucket name in the command and that you pick something that is unlikely to already exist.
2. (If using Cloud9) Navigate to the aws-athena-query-federation/athena-example folder on the left nav. This is the code you extracted back in Step 2.
3. Complete the TODOs in ExampleMetadataHandler by uncommenting the provided example code and providing missing code where indicated.
4. Complete the TODOs in ExampleRecordHandler by uncommenting the provided example code and providing missing code where indicated.
5. Complete the TODOs in ExampleUserDefinedFuncHandler by uncommenting the provided example code and providing missing code where indicated.
6. Upload our sample data by running the following command from aws-athena-query-federation/athena-example directory. Be sure to replace BUCKET_NAME with the name of the bucket your created earlier.  `aws s3 cp ./sample_data.csv s3://BUCKET_NAME/2017/11/1/sample_data.csv`

### Step 5: Package and Deploy Your New Connector

We have two options for deploying our connector: directly to Lambda or via Serverless Application Repository. We'll do both below.

*Publish Your Connector To Serverless Application Repository*

Run `../tools/publish.sh S3_BUCKET_NAME athena-example AWS_REGION` to publish the connector to your private AWS Serverless Application Repository. This will allow users with permission to do so, the ability to deploy instances of the connector via 1-Click form.

If the publish command gave you an error about the aws cli or sam tool not recognizing an argument, you likely forgot to source the new bash profile after
updating your development environment so run `source ~/.profile` and try again.

Then you can navigate to [Serverless Application Repository](https://console.aws.amazon.com/serverlessrepo/home#/available-applications) and click on 'Private applications' and check the box to "Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies" to search for your application and deploy it before using it from Athena. Be sure to use a LOWER_CASE name for yoyr catalog / lambda function when you configure the connector on the Serverless Application Repository console.

### Step 6: Validate our Connector.

One of the most challenging aspects of integrating systems (in this case our connector and Athena) is testing how these two things will work together. Lambda will capture logging from out connector in Cloudwatch Logs but we've also tried to provide some tools to stream line detecting and correcting common semantic and logical issues with your custom connector. By running Athena's connector validation tool you can simulate how Athena will interact with your Lambda function and get access to diagnostic information that would normally only be available within Athena or require you to add extra diagnostics to your connector.

Run `../tools/validate_connector.sh --lambda-func <function_name> --schema schema1 --table table1 --constraints year=2017,month=11,day=1`
Be sure to replace lambda_func with the name you gave to your function/catalog when you deployed it via Serverless Application Repository.

If everything worked as expected you should see the script generate useful debugging info and end with:
```txt
2019-11-07 20:25:08 <> INFO  ConnectorValidator:==================================================
2019-11-07 20:25:08 <> INFO  ConnectorValidator:Successfully Passed Validation!
2019-11-07 20:25:08 <> INFO  ConnectorValidator:==================================================
```

### Step 7: Run a Query!

Ok, now we are ready to try running some queries using our new connector. To do so, create a new workgroup called "AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality" if you haven't already done so. This workgroup will ensure your queries are enabled for our Preview features (UDFs, Federation, Athena ML). Some good examples to try include (be sure to put in your actual database and table names):

Dont forget to create and use an Athena workgroup called "AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality" in the us-east-1 region. When Athena sees a query come from a workgroup with this name, it will enable Federation, UDFs, and SageMaker capabilities for use by your query. Once this feature reaches General Availability this requirement will be lifted.

```sql
USING FUNCTION extract_tx_id(value ROW(id INT, completed boolean) ) 
		RETURNS INT TYPE LAMBDA_INVOKE
WITH (lambda_name = '<function_name>'), FUNCTION decrypt(payload VARCHAR ) 
		RETURNS VARCHAR TYPE LAMBDA_INVOKE
WITH (lambda_name = '<function_name>')
SELECT year,
         month,
         day,
         account_id,
         decrypt(encrypted_payload) AS decrypted_payload,
         extract_tx_id(transaction) AS tx_id
FROM "lambda:<function_name>".schema1.table1
WHERE year=2017
        AND month=11
        AND day=1;
```

You can also try a DDL query:

```sql
show databases in `lambda:<function_name>`;
show tables in `lambda:<function_name>`.schema1;
describe `lambda:<function_name>`.schema1.table1;
```

*note that the <function_name> corresponds to the name of your Lambda function.*

Don't forget to try out [Amazon Athena ML](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/wiki/AthenaML-Tutorial) to apply SageMaker model inference right from your Amazon Athena queries.
