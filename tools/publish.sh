# Run this script from the directory of the module (e.g. athena-example) that you wish to publish.
# This script performs the following actions:
# 1. Builds the maven project
# 2. Creates a Serverless Application Package using the athena-example.yaml
# 3. Produces a final packaged.yaml which can be used to publish the application to your
#     private Serverless Application Repository or deployed via Cloudformation.
# 4. Uploads the packaged connector code to the S3 bucket you specified.
# 5. Uses sar_bucket_policy.json to grant Serverless Application Repository access to our connector code in s3.
# 6. Published the connector to you private Serverless Application Repository where you can 1-click deploy it.
