# Run this script from any directory:
# 1. Builds the maven project, if needed.
# 2. Simulates an Athena query running against your connector that is deployed as a Lambda function.
#
# NOTE: That this test may cause a full table scan against your data source. If prompted to provide a
# query predicate, doing so will avoid a full table scan. You can also opt to stop the simulated query
# after the 'planning phase' so that it does not simulate process any splits.
#
# Use the -h or --help args to print usage information.
#
# Use 'yes | tools/validate_connector.sh [args]' to bypass this check. USE CAUTION
